  This class is a thin wrapper around the PythonInterp class. The Python class
  can always be safely instantiated, but the actual PythonInterp implementation
  depends on whether Python support was enabled when this library instance was
  compiled.

  If one the methods actually invoking the Python interpreter is invoked without
  proper Python support a dummy PythinInterp instance will be used; and that
  will just throw std::logic_error. The operator bool can be used to check if
  this Python manager indeed has a valid Python runtime:


     Python python;

     if (python)
         python.exec("print('Hello world')")
     else
         OpmLog::Error("This version of opmcommon has been built with support for embedded Python");
